These are just my notes after listening to the [CapStable interviews](http://www.capstable.net/csm9/) with the CSM candidates. Thx guys for doing this, it is a great help and i cannot be bothered with reading through the forum posts of all the candidates. My comments are highly subjective and are following the fact that i do not like Goons for reasons. I do not consider voting for candidates, who did not bother to give CapStable an interview. I will also not follow any proposals by some candidates or my block, I like to make up my own mind. Strikethrough candaidates did not get approved or withdraw.

After listening to the interview I still do not know what she stands for. On the other hand her corp is cool and she seems to be cool too. Managed to recommend mostly TMC candidates on air. Everyone seems to like her which makes me suspiciuos. btw GRR TMC

I listened to the whole interview and I still do not know what this guy wants.

#[Angry Mustache](http://capstable.net/2014/03/09/csm9angrymustache/)
This guy loves to play the metagame in his articles and especially in his comments on TMC. Besides beeing a goons, he seems to be a very intelligent man with fresh ideas. If I would have to vote for any goons than I would vote for him.

#[Asayanami Dei](http://www.capstable.net/2014/03/28/csm9asayanamidei/)
Wormholer, who was in E-Uni, which is nice. Did not seem that prepared.

#[Azami Nevinyrall](http://capstable.net/2014/03/07/csm9azaminevinyrall/)
It does not seem to me that he is taking to seriously. He does not like afk cloaking, I do. GRRR goon pets

#[<del>BadAssMcKill</del>](http://capstable.net/2014/03/08/csm9-candidate-interview-badassmckill/)
He asked StupidGenius about specifics, because he is bad at it. Next time prepare plz.

#[Corbexx](http://www.capstable.net/2014/03/29/csm9-candidate-interview-corbexx/)
Another wormhole, seems ok, but his concerns about the game are not really mine.

#[<del>Draleth</del>](http://capstable.net/2014/03/08/csm9draleth/)
Very intelligent guy. It is a shame that he is not running anymore. But this interview convinced me, that is not the guy everyone is demonizing right now within BNI.

#[DJ Funkybacon](http://capstable.net/2014/03/09/csm9djfunkybacon/)
10 years bittervet, lowsec fw guy, who also does eve radio. awesome, could agree to almost everything he said.

#[DNSBlack](http://capstable.net/2014/03/12/csm9dnsblack/)
This guy had nothing to say, i mean really nothing except hot air.

#[James Argent](http://www.capstable.net/2014/04/04/csm9jamesarget/)
Wormhole candidate who is currently at the CSM too. I have no idea about his roles and merrits there. He is anyways playing in area which is currently not mine.

#[Jayne Fillon](http://www.capstable.net/2014/03/14/csm9jaynefillon/)
Seems drama is following this guy everywhere, but I like Sprectre Fleet. Also GRRR TMC

#[Karen Galeo](http://www.capstable.net/2014/03/19/csm9karengaleo/)
Very intelligent wormhole guy, concentrates on lower skill players.

#[Mangala Solaris](http://www.capstable.net/2014/03/24/csm9mangalasolaris/)
I love RvB but unfortunately they have become Goon pets defending their high sec pocos.

#[Matias Otero](http://www.capstable.net/2014/04/05/csm9-candidate-interview-matias-otero/)
He is the founder of Brave Newbies because of that I will vote for him. Having that said as a mamber for five months I have not seen Matias participating in any Brave activities. Maybe it is because our timezones do not match, but it seems to me that he is focussing mostly on communicating with leadership which probably also some issues with staying in touch with their base. I am also not very happy that he takes is candidacy very easy and relies fully on the HERO Block vote. He probably right and will get elected, but not participating in the forums and on #tweetfleet is more or less a sign of disrespect which I do not like to see from a Brave candidate. Anyways I always critize the thing I like the most because i care!-) So got for it Matias you have my vote.

#[Majo JSilva](http://www.capstable.net/2014/03/26/csm9majorjsilva/)
What does this guy stand for except PL? I do not know. But hey at least he is not a goon.

#[Mike Azariah](http://www.capstable.net/2014/03/13/csm9mikeazariah/)
Independend high sec guy. Vote for him.

#[Mynna](http://www.capstable.net/2014/03/25/csm9mynnna/)
It was fun to hear him struggling by Hoots questions. Evil Goon Mastermind. GRRRRR

#[<del>Proclus Diadochu</del>](http://capstable.net/2014/03/12/csm9-candidate-interview-proclus-diadochu/)
Considering myself a passionate troll, I like this guy.

#[prodolegend](http://www.capstable.net/2014/04/02/csm9-candidate-interview-progodlegend/)
The Nulli Secunda candidate, who happens to be also an FC. He has my vote.

#[<del>Psianh Auvyander</del>](http://www.capstable.net/2014/03/18/csm9psianhauvyander/)
He is against TiDi. yipieee. Besides that he seems to be a very intelligent guy asking the right questions. Also he does not seem to be affiliated with any powerblock. He had some very nice ideas to improve sov (building upwards).

#[Psychotic Monk](http://capstable.net/2014/03/11/csm9-candidate-interview-psychotic-monk/)
High Sec guy who likes to wardec and considers himself as a space criminal. Which is currently not my playstyle, but we need such guys in the CSM.

#[Riverini](http://www.capstable.net/2014/03/31/csm9riverini/)
I like this guy. He seems resonable and has some nice ideas around sov null and renting. Definately not Goons too.

#[<del>Roland Cassidy</del>](http://capstable.net/2014/03/13/csm9rolandcassidy/)
Did not get approved. So I do not bother.

#[Sion Kumitono](http://www.capstable.net/2014/03/26/csm9sionkumitomo/)
WTF? How many CSC candidates are there? At least this one does not pretend that he has anything else in mind then goon's interests.

#[Steve Ronuken](http://www.capstable.net/2014/03/15/csm9-candidate-interview-steve-ronuken/)
Man, those brits are always tough to understand for me. But that's my man. He is independent, he is passionate about the game and he is a developer, who did awesome things for eve. Go Steve! My favourite candidate.

#[Sugar Kyle](http://www.capstable.net/2014/03/20/csm9sugarkyle/)
Low Sec Logistics Pirate Lady, she has my vote.

#[Xander Phoena](http://www.capstable.net/2014/04/03/csm9xanderphoena/)
GRR Goons.
