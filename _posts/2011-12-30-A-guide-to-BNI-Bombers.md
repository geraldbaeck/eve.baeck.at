During the last weeks I have been using my stealth bomber at [Brave Newbies](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bravenewbies) quite a lot and for me it was the most fun ship to fly. But flying a bomber is very different to flying other ships at eve. While it is not particullary hard, you should know a thing or two before hoping into a bomber or just do it newbi style.

## Needed Skills

Before you fly a bomber you should train the following skills:

Racial Frigate V
Covert Ops IV
Cloaking IV
Bomb Deployment I
Torpedoes IV
Guided Missile Precision IV
Missile Bomberdment IV
Missile Launcher Operation IV
Missile Projection IV
Rapid Launch IV
Warhead Upgrade IV

You will also find those fitting skills very handy:

CPU Management
Power Grid Management 

I highly reccomend going for Torpedo Specialization IV to be ablte to fit Torpedo Launcher II because they simply do more DPS and the T2 ammo is cheaper. After that you should go for the missile support skills to V.

There is some debate about what's the best stelath bomber. I personally can fly all four of them, but i prefer to use the hound, because of it's versatility, but honestly there is no really bad choice here, so fly what ever racial stealth bomber you like and can fit.

## Different types of running stelth bombers

Before I got into bombers I thought there is only one way to use a stealth bomber whic is launching a bomb toward a target and get the hell out. Of course I am newb and di not know better it turns out there are at least three different uses cases for stealth bombers.

### The Siege Bomber

The Siege Bomber is all about dealing DPS to a structure like a POS or a POCO. Fitting wise you should do everything to do as much damage as possible. If you can fit T2 Torp launchers and T2 Rage Torpedos and as many Ballistic Controll II as you can. In the mids you need and AFterburner II. If you have the fitting space put utility into the remaining mid slots.

Torpedo Launcher II, Nova Rage Torpedo
Covert Ops Cloaking Device II
Bomb Launcher I, Shrapnel Bomb

Small Processor Overclocking Unit I

This is the fit I use, please note that the Bomb Launcher I is offlined, otherwise it would not work.

Your role during a structure bash is to deal damage to the structure. All you have to do is turn your afterburner own and get into an orbit around the structure within your optimal and shoot those torps. To maximize your damage output you should also overheat for one cycle every now and then, because the best structure bashes are the short ones:)

If the enemy POS still has guns you do it like this:
- hit the guns for 2-3 cycles
- cloak up
- wait one cycle
- repeat

If an enemy shows up just cloak and eventually warp out. If your squad leader is on top of his game he will warp the squad out. Do not try to be a hero and solo these assault frigates, they will just tear you apart. The role of the bomber is the role of a coward waiting for his advantage to deal his deadly strikes.

### The Brawling Bomber

This was very new to me. Usually the brawling bomber is used with a covert cyno and a Black Ops Battleship. Meaning one guy lights a covert cyno near the enemy and the Black Ops brigdes the bomber fleet to the action. Unfortunately I do not know anything about covert cyno and Black Ops ships but the FC shouts "TAKE THE BRIDGE" right click that Black Ops in space and hit the jump to something option. You will now jump directly into the action. On Landing immediately click in space anf hit your prop mod to get some transversal, it is your only tank. After that just follow the FCs primaries not like me in that [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv7oZGnfCcU).

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vv7oZGnfCcU?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

As you can see the recipe is very simple:
- Take the bridge via the Black Ops
- On Landing click in space
- Hit your prop mod
- Target the primary
- Fire your torps and overheat
- Do not forget to use your utility mods
- Align to a celestial or orbit anchor
- Follow the FCs orders

A brawling bomber has no need for bombs even fitting an offlined bomb launcher would be waste of ressources. Current BNI doctrine for this is to fit a Medium Shield Extender in the mid, which I am not fully convinced, because i do not think that this extender matters much. But again I am just a newb following orders:)

125mm Railgun II, Spike S

Small Processor Overclocking Unit I

Yes, I am fitting a railgun, just because I can:)

### The Bombing Bomber

Finally the role which a bomber is famous for. Dealing deadly strikes with deadly bombs. This role is totally different from the other two roles. You basically have to wait somewhere cloaked until a target shows up or is called. Align to that target, hit the bomb button and get the hell out. Ideally your target and your warp out are in one line, but that is not always the case. 

Usally you are bombing in squads, which means squads are releasing their bombs together, usally 8 or 9 people are in one squad, because bombs are also damaging each other. Because of that is very important that you use the type of bomb the FC demands when the fleet starts, if you use another type your bomb will destroy all the other bombs and your bomb run will fail.

Once your bomb is launched it travels 30km and explodes within a 15km radius. It is very important that you get out after you launched the bomb, do not burn into the direction of your bomb, you cann definately bomb and kill your self. You should also select your warpout celestial before you launch the bomb.

Fitting a bombing bomber is not very hard. Your most important thing is your Bomb Launcher and your cloak. After that you should focus on agility and tank. I do not like to fit a shield extender here because is just increases your sig radius which means your enemies are able to lock you faster.

I am using one warp core stabilizer because it has proven as very handy if one of youe enemies get lucky or you fuck up the warp out. On Warp out i hit the cloak and immediately afterwards the invul fields which should be within the same server click. But again that tank does not matter much.

## A final note on cloaking

When ever you can cloak up. It should become a habit. *Cloak up and hit warp. Cloak up and hit warp. Cloak up and hit warp.* Do it in this order, make sure you are cloaked before you warp. If you are running in bomber fleet it only takes one uncloaked ship to decloak all his mates and turn the ops into a desaster. Surely this will happen and newbs make a lot of mistakes but it is always nicer to forgive that to ask for forgiveness:)

This is my view on running bombers within Brave Newbies. It currently the vessel i like the most and have the most fun with it. I happy to discuss and correct any mistakes I made. You can contact me (shrinkie) in game or simply comment here.
